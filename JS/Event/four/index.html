            Lorem ipsum is placeholder text used in design to fill spaces before
            the real content is available. It allows designers and developers to
            focus on the layout and visual elements without being distracted by
            meaningful content. This text has been used for centuries as dummy
            text for typesetting, ensuring that spacing and alignment look
            natural.

            It helps designers and developers see how a page will look before
            final text is added, ensuring layout consistency. By using lorem
            ipsum, designers can concentrate on typography, color schemes, and
            user experience without being influenced by the content. It’s a
            practical tool in both print and digital design environments.

            Lorem Ipsum originates from a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero,
            used as dummy text since the 1500s. Over time, it has become the
            industry standard for placeholder text. Modern typesetting software
            and design tools still rely on it to provide realistic-looking text
            blocks without using actual content, helping streamline the design
            process.
