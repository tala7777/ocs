        Cats are curious creatures. They love to explore and play, often getting
        into small spaces and climbing to high spots.
      </div>
      <div class="float-box">
        Domestic cats enjoy napping in sunny spots and purring when happy. They
        also have unique personalities and can be affectionate companions.
      </div>
      <div class="float-box">
        Some cats are very vocal, meowing to communicate with their owners.
        Others prefer silent companionship, showing love through head bumps and
        purring.

      How do I love my cats? Let me count the ways. The clean snap of
      three-year-old Larry’s jaw as he contemplates me with detached curiosity
      is my favourite sound in the world. I love the tenor and cadence of my
      six-month-old kitten Kedi’s miaows as he follows me around the house.
      (High-pitched indignant squeaks means he wants food; lower-pitched
      chirrups suggest he would like to play.) I love the weight of Larry on my
      feet at night and the scratchy caress of Kedi’s tongue on my eyelid in the
      morning. But how do I know what these little tykes really think and feel?
      I fear the authors of online listicles written in cursive fonts are
      unlikely to provide me with the latest scientific research – and are
      probably just saying what they think I want to hear. To truly journey into
      the feline soul, I will have to go to the fountainhead.

        Cats are natural hunters. They enjoy stalking and chasing toys, which
        helps them stay active and mentally stimulated.

        Grooming is an important habit. Cats spend hours cleaning themselves to
        maintain a sleek coat and stay healthy.

        Playtime strengthens the bond with humans. Interactive toys and games
        keep cats engaged and happy.
