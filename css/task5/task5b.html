            Cats are curious creatures. <span class="highlight-orange">They explore</span> every corner of the house, jumping onto shelves and investigating new objects.
            Some cats are very social, while others prefer <span class="highlight-yellow">quiet</span> solitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            Playtime is important. Toys like balls or strings <span class="highlight-orange">stimulate</span> their hunting instincts,
            keeping them healthy and active. Feeding routines also help cats feel <span class="highlight-yellow">secure</span>.

            Grooming is a daily habit for cats. They spend hours cleaning themselves,
            which keeps their coat shiny and <span class="highlight-orange">fur-free</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cats also communicate with humans. They might meow or purr to show <span class="highlight-yellow">affection</span>,
            or give subtle signals when they want attention.
        </p>

            Some cats are very playful and energetic. They love chasing toys, climbing, and exploring new spaces.
            <span class="highlight-yellow">Curiosity</span> drives them to investigate everything around them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding your cat's behavior can strengthen your bond. Providing <span class="highlight-orange">care</span> and
            affection makes them feel safe and happy.
